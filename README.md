# Advent of Code

This is the repository where I'll be posting my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges (adventofcode.com). Feel free to go through my code and provide any feedback.

Note: my code can be extremely messy. I'll go back and add comments when I find more time.

## Repository structure

The repository is sorted out by the year on which the puzzles were put on the website. The year folder is then divided into the puzzle Days (up to 25). 

Inside the Day folder you may find:
- `main.py` - this is the Python script with the solution on it
- `data.txt` - this is the file with the input text given by the website. If the input text is short (e.g. 2015/Day 4) there will be no need for this file
- `text.txt` - this is the file with inputs where I know what the result should be when inputted through the right algorithm. I use this to check if my code is functioning correctly before submitting to the website. If there is no `data.txt` file, this file is probably not going to exist. If the problem was too easy then this file is probably not going to be needed (e.g. 2015/Day 3)
